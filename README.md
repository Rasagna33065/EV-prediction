🔋 Electric Vehicle (EV) Dataset Analysis and Forecasting

Welcome to the EV Vehicle Analysis Project! 🚗⚡

This project focuses on analyzing the features and trends of electric vehicles (EVs) using a structured dataset. It also aims to forecast future adoption and performance trends of EVs using data science techniques.


 📁 Dataset Summary

The dataset used is named "EV_vehicle.csv" and includes important details about various electric vehicle models.

🔸 Columns in the Dataset:
-Brand – Manufacturer name (e.g., Tesla, BMW)
- Model – Vehicle model name
- Year – Year of production
- Battery Capacity (kWh) – Energy capacity of the battery
- Range (km) – Estimated driving range on a full charge
- Plug Type – Charging plug connector type
- Fast Charging – Whether the vehicle supports fast charging
- Energy Consumption (Wh/km) – Efficiency of the vehicle
-Top Speed (km/h) – Maximum speed
- Acceleration (0–100 km/h) – Time taken to reach 100 km/h
- Drive Type – FWD, RWD, AWD
- Body Style – Type of car (SUV, sedan, hatchback, etc.)
- Segment – Market segment

 🎯 Project Objectives

1.Clean and understand the data
2. Analyze trends in EV specifications
3. Visualize key relationships (e.g., battery size vs range)
4. Forecast EV adoption or performance trends
5. Provide insights on EV efficiency and future growth



 📌 Key Questions We Aim to Answer

- Which EV brands offer the best range?
- Is there a correlation between battery capacity and range?
- How has EV efficiency improved over the years?
- What plug types are most commonly used?
- Can we forecast future EV growth?
